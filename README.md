# BST_Tourism

Capstone project for Bhutan Smart Tourism.

## Web app (Next.js + TypeScript)

A Next.js app scaffolded with TypeScript lives in `web/`.

Quick start (Windows PowerShell):

1. Install dependencies

   - This was already done during scaffolding, but you can run it again if needed.

   ```powershell
   cd .\web; npm install
   ```

2. Run the dev server

   ```powershell
   cd .\web; npm run dev
   ```

   Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

3. Build for production

   ```powershell
   cd .\web; npm run build
   ```

4. Start the production server (after building)

   ```powershell
   cd .\web; npm run start
   ```

Notes

- App Router, `src/` directory structure, ESLint, and `@/*` import alias are enabled.
- To add Tailwind CSS later: `cd .\web; npx @next/codemod add-tailwind` or follow the Next.js Tailwind docs.
